## Key Files

- `src/main.js` — Entry point
- `src/effects/registry.js` — Effect definitions
- `src/state/effectStack.js` — Effect stack CRUD
- `src/renderer/pipeline.js` — Processing pipeline
- `src/effects/*.js` — Individual effect modules

## Architecture

Effect stack: effects render strictly in the user-defined stack order. There is no fixed
pipeline — nothing forces one effect before another. Each effect has a `kind` tag
(`transform` | `glsl` | `context` | `reveal` | `marker`) that describes *how* it is
rendered, never *when*.

To add a new effect:
1. Create `src/effects/myEffect.js`
2. Add to `EFFECTS` in `src/effects/registry.js`
